title: "Story Web.8: Tracker Reconciliation"
status: done

## Summary
Bring BMAD tracking back in sync with the repo so the web epic reflects reality and the next dev tasks are obvious.

## Done In This Story
- Added missing story files for:
  - `web-3-check-in-interface`
  - `web-4-real-time-feed-updates`
  - `web-5-roast-threads`
  - `web-6-weekly-recaps`
- Updated `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` to move `web-3..web-6` from `backlog` → `ready-for-dev` with notes about what’s still missing.
- Added follow-up story stubs in `sprint-status.yaml` for ops/auth-linking/subscription hardening.

## Notes
These stories are marked **ready-for-dev** because the UI exists in part, but acceptance criteria still have gaps (notably feed event types, recap sharing, roast parity, and check-in history).
