title: "Story Web.11: Web Roast Threads Parity"
status: ready-for-dev
created: 2026-01-18

## Summary
Bring web roast threads up to parity with the intended feature set: media, reactions, and roast-level gating.

## Notes
`web-5-roast-threads` covers the base experience. This story is specifically the “parity pass” to meet the full acceptance criteria.

## Tasks
- Add emoji reactions for roast responses (DB + UI).
- Add image posting for roast responses (Storage upload + render).
- Add GIF posting (or defer with a clear UI stub and doc).
- Enforce roast-level constraints consistently.
- Add mute/safety controls where required.
